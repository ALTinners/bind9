      BIND 9.12.0 is a new feature release of BIND.  This document
      summarizes new features and functional changes that have been
      introduced on this branch, as well as features that have been
      deprecated or removed.  With each development release leading
      up to the final BIND 9.12.0 release, this document will be
      updated with additional features added and bugs fixed.

	  Addresses could be referenced after being freed during resolver

	<para>
	  Many aspects of <command>named</command> have been modified
	  to improve query performance, and in particular, performance
	  for delegation-heavy zones:
	</para>
	<itemizedlist>
	  <listitem>
	    <para>
	      The additional cache ("acache") was found not to
	      significantly improve performance and has been removed.
	      As a result, the <command>acache-enable</command> and
	      <command>acache-cleaning-interval</command> options no longer
	      have any effect. For backwards compatibility, BIND will
	      accept their presence in a configuration file, but
	      will log a warning.
	    </para>
	  </listitem>
	  <listitem>
	    <para>
	      In place of the acache, <command>named</command> can now use
	      a glue cache to speed up retrieval of glue records when sending
	      delegation responses.  Unlike acache, this feature is on by
	      default; use <command>glue-cache no;</command> to disable it.
	    </para>
	  </listitem>
	  <listitem>
	    <para>
	      <command>minimal-responses</command> is now set
	      to <literal>no-auth-recursive</literal> by default.

	  <listitem>
	    <para>
	      The <command>additional-from-cache</command>
	      and <command>additional-from-auth</command> options no longer
	      have any effect. <command>named</command> will log a warning
	      if they are set.
	    </para>
	  </listitem>
	  <listitem>
	    <para>
	      Several functions have been refactored to improve
	      performance, including name compression, owner name
	      case restoration, hashing, and buffers.
	    </para>
	  </listitem>
	  <listitem>
	    <para>
	      When built with default <command>configure</command> options,
	      <command>named</command> no longer fills memory with tag
	      values when allocating or freeing it. This improves performance,
	      but makes it more difficult to debug certain memory-related
	      errors. The default is reversed if building with developer
	      options. <command>named -M fill</command> or
	      <command>named -M nofill</command> will set the behavior
	      accordingly regardless of build options.

      <listitem>
	<para>
	  Several areas of code have been refactored for improved
	  readability, maintainability, and testability:
	</para>
	<itemizedlist>
	  <listitem>
	    <para>
	      The <command>named</command> query logic implemented in
	      <command>query_find()</command> has been split into
	      smaller functions with a context structure to maintain state
	      between them, and extensive comments have been added.
	      [RT #43929]
	    </para>
	  </listitem>
	  <listitem>
	    <para>
	      Similarly the iterative query logic implemented in
	      <command>resquery_response()</command> function has been
	      split into smaller functions and comments added. [RT #45362]
	    </para>
	  </listitem>
	</itemizedlist>
      </listitem>
      <listitem>
	<para>
	  Code implementing name server query processing has been moved
	  from <command>named</command> to an external library,
	  <command>libns</command>. This will make it easier to
	  write unit tests for the code, or to link it into new tools.
	  [RT #45186]
	</para>
      </listitem>
      <listitem>
	<para>
	  <command>named</command> can now synthesize negative responses
	  (NXDOMAIN, NODATA, or wildcard answers) from cached DNSSEC-verified
	  records that were returned in negative or wildcard responses from
	  authoritative servers.
	</para>
	<para>
	  This will reduce query loads on authoritative servers for signed
	  domains: when existing cached records can be used by the resolver
	  to determine that a name does not exist in the authoritative domain,
	  no query needs to be sent. Reducing the number of iterative queries
	  should also improve resolver performance.
	</para>
	<para>
	  This behavior is controlled by the new
	  <filename>named.conf</filename> option
	  <command>synth-from-dnssec</command>.  It is enabled by
	  default.
	</para>
	<para>
	  Note: this currently only works for zones signed using NSEC.
	  Support for zones signed using NSEC3 (without opt-out) is
	  planned for the future.
	</para>
	<para>
	  Thanks to APNIC for sponsoring this work.
	</para>
      </listitem>
      <listitem>
	<para>
	  When acting as a recursive resolver, <command>named</command>
	  can now continue returning answers whose TTLs have expired
	  when the authoritative server is under attack and unable to
	  respond. This is controlled by the
	  <command>stale-answer-enable</command>,
	  <command>stale-answer-ttl</command> and
	  <command>max-stale-ttl</command> options. [RT #44790]
	</para>
      </listitem>
      <listitem>
	<para>
	  The DNS Response Policy Service (DNSRPS) API, a mechanism to
	  allow <command>named</command> to use an external response policy
	  provider, is now supported. (One example of such a provider is
	  "FastRPZ" from Farsight Security, Inc.) This allows the same
	  types of policy filtering as standard RPZ, but can reduce the
	  workload for <command>named</command>, particularly when using
	  large and frequently-updated policy zones. It also enables
	  <command>named</command> to share response policy providers
	  with other DNS implementations such as Unbound.
	</para>
	<para>
	  This feature is available if BIND is built with
	  <command>configure --enable-dnsrps</command>, if a DNSRPS
	  provider is installed, and if <command>dnsrps-enable</command>
	  is set to "yes" in <filename>named.conf</filename>. Standard
	  built-in RPZ is used otherwise.
	</para>

      <listitem>
	<para>
	  Setting <command>max-journal-size</command> to
	  <literal>default</literal> limits journal sizes to twice the
	  size of the zone contents.  This can be overridden by setting
	  <command>max-journal-size</command> to <literal>unlimited</literal>
	  or to an explicit value up to 2G. Thanks to Tony Finch for

      <listitem>
	<para>
	  <command>dnstap</command> logfiles can now be configured to
	  automatically roll when they reach a specified size. If
	  <command>dnstap-output</command> is configured with mode
	  <literal>file</literal>, then it can take optional
	  <command>size</command> and <command>versions</command>
	  key-value arguments to set the logfile rolling parameters.
	  (These have the same semantics as the corresponding
	  options in a <command>logging</command> channel statement.)

	</para>
      </listitem>
      <listitem>
	<para>
	  Logging channels and <command>dnstap-output</command> files can
	  now be configured with a <command>suffix</command> option,
	  set to either <literal>increment</literal> or
	  <literal>timestamp</literal>, indicating whether log files
	  should be given incrementing suffixes when they roll
	  over (e.g., <filename>logfile.0</filename>,
	  <filename>.1</filename>, <filename>.2</filename>, etc)
	  or suffixes indicating the time of the roll. The default
	  is <literal>increment</literal>.  [RT #42838]

      </listitem>
      <listitem>
	<para>
	  The <command>print-time</command> option in the
	  <command>logging</command> configuration can now take arguments
	  <userinput>local</userinput>, <userinput>iso8601</userinput> or
	  <userinput>iso8601-utc</userinput> to indicate the format in
	  which the date and time should be logged. For backward
	  compatibility, <userinput>yes</userinput> is a synonym for
	  <userinput>local</userinput>.  [RT #42585]

	<para>
	  The new <command>dnssec-cds</command> command generates a new DS
	  set to place in a parent zone, based on the contents of a child

	  <filename>dsset</filename> file suitable for input to
	  <command>dnssec-signzone</command>, or a series of
	  <command>nsupdate</command> commands to update the parent zone
	  via dynamic DNS. Thanks to Tony Finch for the contribution.

	</para>
      </listitem>
      <listitem>

	  <command>nsec3hash -r</command> ("rdata order") takes arguments

	  <command>rndc</command> commands which refer to zone names
	  can now reference a zone of type <command>redirect</command>
	  by using the special zone name "-redirect". (Previously this

	  always have the name ".", which can be ambiguous.)
	</para>

	</para>
      </listitem>
      <listitem>
	<para>
	  By default, BIND now uses the random number generation functions
	  in the cryptographic library (i.e., OpenSSL or a PKCS#11
	  provider) as a source of high-quality randomness rather than
	  <filename>/dev/random</filename>.  This is suitable for virtual
	  machine environments, which may have limited entropy pools and
	  lack hardware random number generators.
	</para>
	<para>
	  This can be overridden by specifying another entropy source via
	  the <command>random-device</command> option in
	  <filename>named.conf</filename>, or via the <command>-r</command>
	  command line option.  However, for functions requiring full
	  cryptographic strength, such as DNSSEC key generation, this
	  <emphasis>cannot</emphasis> be overridden. In particular, the
	  <command>-r</command> command line option no longer has any
	  effect on <command>dnssec-keygen</command>.
	</para>
	<para>
	  This can be disabled by building with
	  <command>configure --disable-crypto-rand</command>, in which
	  case <filename>/dev/random</filename> will be the default
	  entropy source.  [RT #31459] [RT #46047]

	</para>
	<para>
	  This is intended for testing purposes, but can be used -- with

	  substantially refactored: updates to the RPZ summary
	  database are no longer directly performed by the zone
	  database but by a separate function that is called when
	  a policy zone is updated.  This improves both performance
	  and reliability when policy zones receive frequent updates.
	  Summary database updates can be rate-limited by using the
	  <command>min-update-interval</command> option in a
	  <command>response-policy</command> statement. [RT #43449]

      BIND is open source software licenced under the terms of the Mozilla
      Public License, version 2.0 (see the <filename>LICENSE</filename>
      file for the full text).
    </para>
    <para>
      The license requires that if you make changes to BIND and distribute
      them outside your organization, those changes must be published under
      the same license. It does not require that you publish or disclose
      anything other than the changes you have made to our software.  This
      requirement does not affect anyone who is using BIND, with or without
      modifications, without redistributing it, nor anyone redistributing
      BIND without changes.

    <para>
      The end-of-life date for BIND 9.12 has not yet been determined.
      However, it is not intended to be an Extended Support Version (ESV)
      branch; accordingly, support will end after the next stable
      branch (9.14) becomes available.  Those needing a longer-lived
      branch are encouraged to use the current ESV, BIND 9.11, which
      will be supported until December 2021. See
