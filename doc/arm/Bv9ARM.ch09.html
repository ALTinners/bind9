      BIND 9.12.0 is a new feature release of BIND.  This document
      summarizes new features and functional changes that have been
      introduced on this branch, as well as features that have been
      deprecated or removed.

<li class="listitem">
	<p>
	  Many aspects of <span class="command"><strong>named</strong></span> have been modified
	  to improve query performance, and in particular, performance
	  for delegation-heavy zones:
	</p>
	<div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" style="list-style-type: circle; ">
<li class="listitem">
	    <p>
	      The additional cache ("acache") was found not to
	      significantly improve performance and has been removed.
	      As a result, the <span class="command"><strong>acache-enable</strong></span> and
	      <span class="command"><strong>acache-cleaning-interval</strong></span> options no longer
	      have any effect. For backwards compatibility, BIND will
	      accept their presence in a configuration file, but
	      will log a warning.
	    </p>
	  </li>
<li class="listitem">
	    <p>
	      In place of the acache, <span class="command"><strong>named</strong></span> can now use
	      a glue cache to speed up retrieval of glue records when sending
	      delegation responses.  Unlike acache, this feature is on by
	      default; use <span class="command"><strong>glue-cache no;</strong></span> to disable it.
	    </p>
	  </li>
<li class="listitem">
	    <p>
	      <span class="command"><strong>minimal-responses</strong></span> is now set
	      to <code class="literal">no-auth-recursive</code> by default.
	    </p>
	  </li>
<li class="listitem">
	    <p>
	      The <span class="command"><strong>additional-from-cache</strong></span>
	      and <span class="command"><strong>additional-from-auth</strong></span> options no longer
	      have any effect. <span class="command"><strong>named</strong></span> will log a warning
	      if they are set.
	    </p>
	  </li>
<li class="listitem">
	    <p>
	      Several functions have been refactored to improve
	      performance, including name compression, owner name
	      case restoration, hashing, and buffers.
	    </p>
	  </li>
<li class="listitem">
	    <p>
	      When built with default <span class="command"><strong>configure</strong></span> options,
	      <span class="command"><strong>named</strong></span> no longer fills memory with tag
	      values when allocating or freeing it. This improves performance,
	      but makes it more difficult to debug certain memory-related
	      errors. The default is reversed if building with developer
	      options. <span class="command"><strong>named -M fill</strong></span> or
	      <span class="command"><strong>named -M nofill</strong></span> will set the behavior
	      accordingly regardless of build options.

	  Several areas of code have been refactored for improved
	  readability, maintainability, and testability:
	</p>
	<div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" style="list-style-type: circle; ">
<li class="listitem">
	    <p>
	      The <span class="command"><strong>named</strong></span> query logic implemented in
	      <span class="command"><strong>query_find()</strong></span> has been split into
	      smaller functions with a context structure to maintain state
	      between them, and extensive comments have been added.
	      [RT #43929]
	    </p>
	  </li>
<li class="listitem">
	    <p>
	      Similarly the iterative query logic implemented in
	      <span class="command"><strong>resquery_response()</strong></span> function has been
	      split into smaller functions and comments added. [RT #45362]
	    </p>
	  </li>
</ul></div>
      </li>
<li class="listitem">
	<p>
	  Code implementing name server query processing has been moved
	  from <span class="command"><strong>named</strong></span> to an external library,
	  <span class="command"><strong>libns</strong></span>. This will make it easier to
	  write unit tests for the code, or to link it into new tools.
	  [RT #45186]
	</p>
      </li>
<li class="listitem">
	<p>
	  <span class="command"><strong>named</strong></span> can now synthesize negative responses
	  (NXDOMAIN, NODATA, or wildcard answers) from cached DNSSEC-verified
	  records that were returned in negative or wildcard responses from
	  authoritative servers.
	</p>
	<p>
	  This will reduce query loads on authoritative servers for signed
	  domains: when existing cached records can be used by the resolver
	  to determine that a name does not exist in the authoritative domain,
	  no query needs to be sent. Reducing the number of iterative queries
	  should also improve resolver performance.
	</p>
	<p>
	  This behavior is controlled by the new
	  <code class="filename">named.conf</code> option
	  <span class="command"><strong>synth-from-dnssec</strong></span>.  It is enabled by
	  default.
	</p>
	<p>
	  Note: this currently only works for zones signed using NSEC.
	  Support for zones signed using NSEC3 (without opt-out) is
	  planned for the future.

	<p>
	  Thanks to APNIC for sponsoring this work.

<li class="listitem">
	<p>
	  When acting as a recursive resolver, <span class="command"><strong>named</strong></span>
	  can now continue returning answers whose TTLs have expired
	  when the authoritative server is under attack and unable to
	  respond. This is controlled by the
	  <span class="command"><strong>stale-answer-enable</strong></span>,
	  <span class="command"><strong>stale-answer-ttl</strong></span> and
	  <span class="command"><strong>max-stale-ttl</strong></span> options. [RT #44790]

<li class="listitem">
	<p>
	  The DNS Response Policy Service (DNSRPS) API, a mechanism to
	  allow <span class="command"><strong>named</strong></span> to use an external response policy
	  provider, is now supported. (One example of such a provider is
	  "FastRPZ" from Farsight Security, Inc.) This allows the same
	  types of policy filtering as standard RPZ, but can reduce the
	  workload for <span class="command"><strong>named</strong></span>, particularly when using
	  large and frequently-updated policy zones. It also enables
	  <span class="command"><strong>named</strong></span> to share response policy providers
	  with other DNS implementations such as Unbound.
	</p>
	<p>
	  This feature is available if BIND is built with
	  <span class="command"><strong>configure --enable-dnsrps</strong></span>, if a DNSRPS
	  provider is installed, and if <span class="command"><strong>dnsrps-enable</strong></span>
	  is set to "yes" in <code class="filename">named.conf</code>. Standard
	  built-in RPZ is used otherwise.

	  By default, BIND now uses the random number generation functions

	  provider) as a source of high-quality randomness rather than
	  <code class="filename">/dev/random</code>.  This is suitable for virtual
	  machine environments, which may have limited entropy pools and
	  lack hardware random number generators.
	</p>
	<p>
	  This can be overridden by specifying another entropy source via
	  the <span class="command"><strong>random-device</strong></span> option in
	  <code class="filename">named.conf</code>, or via the <span class="command"><strong>-r</strong></span>

      The end-of-life date for BIND 9.12 has not yet been determined.
      However, it is not intended to be an Extended Support Version (ESV)
      branch; accordingly, support will end after the next stable
      branch (9.14) becomes available.  Those needing a longer-lived
      branch are encouraged to use the current ESV, BIND 9.11, which
      will be supported until December 2021. See
      <a class="link" href="https://www.isc.org/downloads/software-support-policy/" target="_top">https://www.isc.org/downloads/software-support-policy/</a>
