Security Fixes

  * There was a long-existing flaw in the documentation for ms-self,
    krb5-self, ms-subdomain, and krb5-subdomain rules in update-policy
    statements. Though the policies worked as intended, operators who
    configured their servers according to the misleading documentation may
    have thought zone updates were more restricted than they were; users
    of these rule types are advised to review the documentation and
    correct their configurations if necessary. New rule types matching the
    previously documented behavior will be introduced in a future
    maintenance release. [GL !708]

  * named could crash during recursive processing of DNAME records when
    deny-answer-aliases was in use. This flaw is disclosed in
    CVE-2018-5740. [GL #387]

New Features

  * None.

Feature Changes

  * None.

Bug Fixes

  * Running rndc reconfig could cause inline-signing to stop signing. [GL
    #439]

  * Reloading all zones caused zone maintenance to stop for inline-signing
    zones. [GL #435]

  * Signatures loaded from the journal for the signed version
    inline-signing zone were not scheduled for refresh. [GL #482]

  * A referral response with a non-empty ANSWER section was incorrectly
    treated as an error; this caused certain domains to be non-resolvable.
    [GL #390]

End of Life

The end-of-life date for BIND 9.12 has not yet been determined. However,
it is not intended to be an Extended Support Version (ESV) branch;
accordingly, support will end after the next stable branch (9.14) becomes
available. Those needing a longer-lived branch are encouraged to use the
current ESV, BIND 9.11, which will be supported until December 2021. See
https://www.isc.org/downloads/software-support-policy/ for details of
