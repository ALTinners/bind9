.Sh NAME
.Nm dnssec-signkey
.Nd DNSSEC keyset signing tool
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm dnssec-signkey
.Op Fl h
.Op Fl p
.Op Fl r Ar randomdev
.Op Fl v Ar level
.Ar keyset
.Ar keyfile ...
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm dnssec-signkey
is used to sign a key set for a child zone.
Typically this would be provided by a 
.Ar .keyset
file generated by
.Xr dnssec-makekeyset 8 .
This provides a mechanism for a DNSSEC-aware zone to sign the keys of
any DNSSEC-aware child zones.
The child zone's key set gets signed with the zone keys for its parent
zone.
.Ar keyset
will be the pathname of the child zone's
.Ar .keyset
file.
Each
.Ar keyfile
argument will be a key identification string as reported by
.Xr dnssec-keygen 8
for the parent zone.
This allows the child's keys to be signed by more than one 
parent zone key.
.Pp
The
.Fl h
option makes
.Nm dnssec-signkey
print a short summary of its command line options
and arguments.
.Pp
.Nm dnssec-signkey
may need random numbers in the process of generating keys.
If the system does not have a
.Pa /dev/random
device that can be used for generating random numbers,
.Nm dnssec-signkey
will prompt for keyboard input and use the time intervals between
keystrokes to provide randomness.
The
.Fl r
option overrides this behaviour, making
.Nm dnssec-signkey
use
.Ar randomdev
as a source of random data.
.Pp
The
.Fl p
option instructs
.Nm dnssec-signkey
to use pseudo-random data when signing the keys.  This is faster, but
less secure, than using genuinely random data for signing.
This option may be useful when there are many child zone keysets to
sign or if the entropy source is limited.
It could also be used for short-lived keys and signatures that don't
require as much protection against cryptanalysis, such as when the key
will be discarded long before it could be compromised.
.Pp
The
.Fl v
option can be used to make
.Nm dnssec-signkey
more verbose.
As the debugging/tracing level
.Ar level
increases,
.Nm dnssec-signkey
generates increasingly detailed reports about what it is doing.
The default level is zero.
.Pp
When
.Nm dnssec-signkey
completes successfully, it generates a file called
.Ar nnnn.signedkey
containing the signed keys for child zone
.Ar nnnn .
The keys from the
.Ar keyset
file will have been signed by the parent zone's key or keys which were
supplied as
.Ar keyfile
arguments.
This file should be sent to the DNS administrator of the child zone.
They arrange for its contents to be incorporated into the zone file
when it next gets signed with
.Xr dnssec-signzone 8 .
A copy of the generated
.Ar signedkey
file should be kept by the parent zone's DNS administrator, since
it will be needed when signing the parent zone.
.Sh EXAMPLE
The DNS administrator for a DNSSEC-aware
.Dv .com
zone would use the following command to make
.Nm dnssec-signkey
sign the
.Ar .keyset
file for
.Dv example.com
created in the example shown in the man page for
.Xr dnssec-makekeyset 8 :
.Pp
.Dl # dnssec-signkey example.com.keyset Kcom.+003+51944
.Pp
where
.Dv Kcom.+003+51944
was a key file identifier that was produced when
.Xr dnssec-keygen 8
generated a key for the
.Dv .com
zone.
.Pp
.Nm dnssec-signkey
will produce a file called
.Dv example.com.signedkey
which has the keys for
.Dv example.com
signed by the
.Dv com
zone's zone key.
