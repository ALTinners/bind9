   None.

Security Fixes

9.4-ESV-R5rc1

     * A bug in NetBSD and FreeBSD kernels with SO_ACCEPTFILTER enabled
       allows for a TCP DoS attack. Until there is a kernel fix, ISC is
       disabling SO_ACCEPTFILTER support in BIND. [RT #22589]
     * named, set up to be a caching resolver, is vulnerable to a user
       querying a domain with very large resource record sets (RRSets)
       when trying to negatively cache the response. Due to an off-by-one
       error, caching the response could cause named to crash. [RT #24650]
       [CVE-2011-1910]

Bug Fixes

9.4-ESV-R5rc1

     * Improved the mechanism for flagging database entries as negative
       cache records; the former method, RR type 0, could be ambiguous.
       [RT #24777]
     * During RFC5011 processing some journal write errors were not
       detected. This could lead to managed-keys changes being committed
       but not recorded in the journal files, causing potential
       inconsistencies during later processing. [RT #20256]
     * A potential NULL pointer deference in the DNS64 code could cause
       named to terminate unexpectedly. [RT #20256]
     * A state variable relating to DNSSEC could fail to be set during
       some infrequently-executed code paths, allowing it to be used
       whilst in an unitialized state during cache updates, with
       unpredictable results. [RT #20256]
     * A potential NULL pointer deference in DNSSEC signing code could
       cause named to terminate unexpectedly [RT #20256]
     * Several cosmetic code changes were made to silence warnings
       generated by a static code analysis tool. [RT #20256]
     * Cause named to terminate at startup or rndc reconfig reload to
       fail, if a log file specified in the conf file isn't a plain file.
       (RT #22771]
     * Prior to this fix, when named was was writing a zone to disk (as
       slave, when resigning, etc.), it might not correctly preserve the
       case of domain name labels within RDATA, if the RDATA was not
       compressible. The result is that when reloading the zone from disk
       would, named could serve data that did not match the RRSIG for that
       data, due to case mismatch. named now correctly preserves case.
       After upgrading to fixed code, the operator should either resign
       the data (on the master) or delete the disk file on the slave and
       reload the zone. [RT #22863]
     * Fix the zonechecks system test to fail on error (warning in 9.6,
       fatal in 9.7) to match behaviour for 9.4. [RT #22905]
     * There was a bug in how the clients-per-query code worked with some
       query patterns. This could result, in rare circumstances, in having
       all the client query slots filled with queries for the same DNS
       label, essentially ignoring the max-clients-per-query setting. [RT
       #22972]
     * Fixed precedence order bug with NS and DNAME records if both are
       present. (Also fixed timing of autosign test in 9.7+) [RT #23035]
     * Changing TTL did not cause dnssec-signzone to generate new
       signatures. [RT #23330]
     * If named encountered a CNAME instead of a DS record when walking
       the chain of trust down from the trust anchor, it incorrectly
       stopped validating. [RT #23338]
     * RRSIG records could have time stamps too far in the future. [RT
       #23356]
     * If running on a powerpc CPU and with atomic operations enabled,
       named could lock up. Added sync instructions to the end of atomic
       operations. [RT #23469]
     * ixfr-from-differences {master|slave}; failed to select the
       master/slave zones, resulting in on diff/journal file being
       created. [RT #23580]
     * Remove bin/tests/system/logfileconfig/ns1/named.conf and add
       setup.sh in order to resolve changing named.conf issue. [RT #23687]
     * The autosign tests attempted to open ports within reserved ranges.
       Test now avoids those ports. [RT #23957]
     * Named could fail to validate zones list in a DLV that validated
       insecure without using DLV and had DS records in the parent zone.
       [RT #24631]
