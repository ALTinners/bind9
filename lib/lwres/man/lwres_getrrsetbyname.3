The following structures are used:

.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.PP
 \fBlwres_getrrsetbyname()\fR gets a set of resource records associated with a \fIhostname\fR, \fIclass\fR, and \fItype\fR\&. \fIhostname\fR is a pointer a to null\-terminated string\&. The \fIflags\fR field is currently unused and must be zero\&.
.PP
After a successful call to \fBlwres_getrrsetbyname()\fR, \fI*res\fR is a pointer to an \fBrrsetinfo\fR structure, containing a list of one or more \fBrdatainfo\fR structures containing resource records and potentially another list of \fBrdatainfo\fR structures containing SIG resource records associated with those records\&. The members \fBrri_rdclass\fR and \fBrri_rdtype\fR are copied from the parameters\&. \fBrri_ttl\fR and \fBrri_name\fR are properties of the obtained rrset\&. The resource records contained in \fBrri_rdatas\fR and \fBrri_sigs\fR are in uncompressed DNS wire format\&. Properties of the rdataset are represented in the \fBrri_flags\fR bitfield\&. If the RRSET_VALIDATED bit is set, the data has been DNSSEC validated and the signatures verified\&.
.PP
All of the information returned by \fBlwres_getrrsetbyname()\fR is dynamically allocated: the \fBrrsetinfo\fR and \fBrdatainfo\fR structures, and the canonical host name strings pointed to by the \fBrrsetinfo\fRstructure\&. Memory allocated for the dynamically allocated structures created by a successful call to \fBlwres_getrrsetbyname()\fR is released by \fBlwres_freerrset()\fR\&. \fIrrset\fR is a pointer to a \fBstruct rrset\fR created by a call to \fBlwres_getrrsetbyname()\fR\&.
.PP
.SH "RETURN VALUES"
.PP
 \fBlwres_getrrsetbyname()\fR returns zero on success, and one of the following error codes if an error occurred: 
.TP
\fBERRSET_NONAME\fR
the name does not exist
.TP
\fBERRSET_NODATA\fR
the name exists, but does not have data of the desired type
.TP
\fBERRSET_NOMEMORY\fR
memory could not be allocated
.TP
\fBERRSET_INVAL\fR
a parameter is invalid
.TP
\fBERRSET_FAIL\fR
other failure
.TP
\fB\fR
