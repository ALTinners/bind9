This is a simple test environment for running bind9 system tests
involving multiple name servers.

There are multiple test suites, each in a separate subdirectory and
involving a different DNS setup.  They are:

  xfer/		Zone transfer, update, and NOTIFY tests
  notify/	More NOTIFY tests
  xferquota/	Zone transfer quota tests
  dnssec/	DNSSEC tests

Typically each test suite sets up 2-5 name servers and then performs
one or more tests against them.  Within the test suite subdirectory,
each name server has a separate subdirectory containing its
configuration data.  By convention, these subdirectories are named
"ns1", "ns2", etc.

The tests are completely self-contained and do not require access to
the real DNS.  Generally, one of the test servers (ns1) is set up as a
root name server and is listed in the hints file of the others.

To enable all servers to run on the same machine, they bind to
separate virtual IP address on the loopback interface.  ns1 runs on
10.53.0.1, ns2 on 10.53.0.2, etc.  Before running any tests, you must
set up these addresses by running the script "ifconfig.sh start".

The servers do not bind to port 53, so can be run as a normal user once the
interfaces are set up.

To run the tests:

  sh run.sh xfer

  sh run.sh notify

  etc.
