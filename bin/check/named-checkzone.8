.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.PP
\fBnamed\-checkzone\fR
checks the syntax and integrity of a zone file. It performs the same checks as
\fBnamed\fR
does when loading a zone. This makes
\fBnamed\-checkzone\fR
useful for checking zone files before configuring them into a name server.
.PP
\fBnamed\-compilezone\fR
is similar to
\fBnamed\-checkzone\fR, but it always dumps the zone contents to a specified file in a specified format. Additionally, it applies stricter check levels by default, since the dump output will be used as an actual zone file loaded by
\fBnamed\fR. When manaully specified otherwise, the check levels must at least be as strict as those specified in the
\fBnamed\fR
configuration file.
.SH "OPTIONS"
.TP 3n
\-d
Enable debugging.
.TP 3n
\-q
Quiet mode \- exit code only.
.TP 3n
\-v
Print the version of the
\fBnamed\-checkzone\fR
program and exit.
.TP 3n
\-j
When loading the zone file read the journal if it exists.
.TP 3n
\-c \fIclass\fR
Specify the class of the zone. If not specified "IN" is assumed.
.TP 3n
\-i \fImode\fR
Perform post load zone integrity checks. Possible modes are
\fB"full"\fR
(default),
\fB"full\-sibling"\fR,
\fB"local"\fR,
\fB"local\-sibling"\fR
and
\fB"none"\fR.
.sp
Mode
\fB"full"\fR
checks that MX records refer to A or AAAA record (both in\-zone and out\-of\-zone hostnames). Mode
\fB"local"\fR
only checks MX records which refer to in\-zone hostnames.
.sp
Mode
\fB"full"\fR
checks that SRV records refer to A or AAAA record (both in\-zone and out\-of\-zone hostnames). Mode
\fB"local"\fR
only checks SRV records which refer to in\-zone hostnames.
.sp
Mode
\fB"full"\fR
checks that delegation NS records refer to A or AAAA record (both in\-zone and out\-of\-zone hostnames). It also checks that glue addresses records in the zone match those advertised by the child. Mode
\fB"local"\fR
only checks NS records which refer to in\-zone hostnames or that some required glue exists, that is when the nameserver is in a child zone.
.sp
Mode
\fB"full\-sibling"\fR
and
\fB"local\-sibling"\fR
disable sibling glue checks but are otherwise the same as
\fB"full"\fR
and
\fB"local"\fR
respectively.
.sp
Mode
\fB"none"\fR
disables the checks.
.TP 3n
\-f \fIformat\fR
Specify the format of the zone file. Possible formats are
\fB"text"\fR
(default) and
\fB"raw"\fR.
.TP 3n
\-F \fIformat\fR
Specify the format of the output file specified. Possible formats are
\fB"text"\fR
(default) and
\fB"raw"\fR. For
\fBnamed\-checkzone\fR, this does not cause any effects unless it dumps the zone contents.
.TP 3n
\-k \fImode\fR
Perform
\fB"check\-name"\fR
checks with the specified failure mode. Possible modes are
\fB"fail"\fR
(default for
\fBnamed\-compilezone\fR),
\fB"warn"\fR
(default for
\fBnamed\-checkzone\fR) and
\fB"ignore"\fR.
.TP 3n
\-m \fImode\fR
Specify whether MX records should be checked to see if they are addresses. Possible modes are
\fB"fail"\fR,
\fB"warn"\fR
(default) and
\fB"ignore"\fR.
.TP 3n
\-M \fImode\fR
Check if a MX record refers to a CNAME. Possible modes are
\fB"fail"\fR,
\fB"warn"\fR
(default) and
\fB"ignore"\fR.
.TP 3n
\-n \fImode\fR
Specify whether NS records should be checked to see if they are addresses. Possible modes are
\fB"fail"\fR
(default for
\fBnamed\-compilezone\fR),
\fB"warn"\fR
(default for
\fBnamed\-checkzone\fR) and
\fB"ignore"\fR.
.TP 3n
\-o \fIfilename\fR
Write zone output to
\fIfilename\fR. This is mandatory for
\fBnamed\-compilezone\fR.
.TP 3n
\-s \fIstyle\fR
Specify the style of the dumped zone file. Possible styles are
\fB"full"\fR
(default) and
\fB"relative"\fR. The full format is most suitable for processing automatically by a separate script. On the other hand, the relative format is more human\-readable and is thus suitable for editing by hand. For
\fBnamed\-checkzone\fR
this does not cause any effects unless it dumps the zone contents. It also does not have any meaning if the output format is not text.
.TP 3n
\-S \fImode\fR
Check if a SRV record refers to a CNAME. Possible modes are
\fB"fail"\fR,
\fB"warn"\fR
(default) and
\fB"ignore"\fR.
.TP 3n
\-t \fIdirectory\fR
chroot to
\fIdirectory\fR
so that include directives in the configuration file are processed as if run by a similarly chrooted named.
.TP 3n
\-w \fIdirectory\fR
chdir to
\fIdirectory\fR
so that relative filenames in master file $INCLUDE directives work. This is similar to the directory clause in
\fInamed.conf\fR.
.TP 3n
\-D
Dump zone file in canonical format. This is always enabled for
\fBnamed\-compilezone\fR.
.TP 3n
\-W \fImode\fR
Specify whether to check for non\-terminal wildcards. Non\-terminal wildcards are almost always the result of a failure to understand the wildcard matching algorithm (RFC 1034). Possible modes are
\fB"warn"\fR
(default) and
\fB"ignore"\fR.
.TP 3n
zonename
The domain name of the zone being checked.
.TP 3n
filename
The name of the zone file.
.SH "RETURN VALUES"
.PP
\fBnamed\-checkzone\fR
returns an exit status of 1 if errors were detected and 0 otherwise.
